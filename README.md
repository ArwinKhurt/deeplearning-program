✅ README #1 — Deep Learning Program (PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow)

Title: Deep Learning Multi-Framework Program
Frameworks Used: PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow
Language: Python
IDE: VS Code

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build simple deep-learning models using three major frameworks:

PyTorch

TensorFlow

Keras

The goal is to show how each framework trains a basic neural network, loads data, builds layers, trains the model, and displays results.

The project can be used as:

A beginner reference for deep learning

A comparison between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras

A template for school or university projects

🧠 What Each File Does
1️⃣ PyTorch Model — pytorch_model.py

Builds a simple feed-forward neural network

Uses the MNIST-like random data

Trains the model for several epochs

Prints training loss

2️⃣ TensorFlow Model — tensorflow_model.py

Builds a dense neural network

Compiles with Adam optimizer

Trains using TensorFlow’s .fit()

Shows accuracy and loss

3️⃣ Keras Model — keras_model.py

Uses Keras sequential API

Builds and trains a classifier model

Prints training progress per epoch

Saves the model to disk

▶️ How to Run the Program
Install necessary libraries:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install numpy matplotlib

Run the PyTorch model:
python pytorch_model.py

Run the TensorFlow model:
python tensorflow_model.py

Run the Keras model:
python keras_model.py

📊 Expected Output

Each framework prints:

Epoch number

Loss

Accuracy (if included)

Example output:

Epoch 1/5 — Loss: 0.62
Epoch 2/5 — Loss: 0.41
Training complete!

📘 Explanation of Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning where models learn patterns by passing data through multiple layers. Each layer transforms the input into more meaningful features.

This project uses:

Dense/Linear layers

Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax)

Loss functions (CrossEntropy, SparseCategoricalCrossentropy)

Optimizers (Adam)

The goal is to show how each framework handles training differently.
